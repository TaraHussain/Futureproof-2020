## Exercise 1

Created a website based on my cohort's eponym, Ric Weiland.
Wrote the code in VS Code, experimenting with new tags and layout options and then deployed via the command line using Netlify's CLI tool.

## Exercise 2

Continued to work on Weiland site found here (https://github.com/TaraHussain/Futureproof-Wk1-Ex1), improving my CSS.
Focussed on required selectors, comments, whitespace, trying to keep code clean and easy for humans to read.

## Exercise 3

Created a website using the CSS Framework _NES.css_ (https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css) which includes three pages, a navigation bar and interactive buttons.

## Exercise 4

Created a website based on a random topic generated by Wiki Roulette. The stylesheet uses media queries to make the website more responsive to various break points.
